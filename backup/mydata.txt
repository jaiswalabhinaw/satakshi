About

"Our journey is incomplete until the last person in society smiles."

The inception of Shatakshi Seva Sansthan was not just about establishing an organization; it was a resolve born out of pain. A young man, who lost his younger brother and witnessed the sorrow of abandoned bodies lying on the streets, decided that the sole purpose of his life would now be the service of humanity. This young man is today our founder, Mr. Naveen Ranjan Srivastava.

🌱 The Ground of Beginnings

This vision, born in the soil of Manikpur village, Gopalganj, Bihar, gradually grew into a movement. In 2011, the Shatakshi Educational and Welfare Trust was established. This foundation was built not only with bricks and stones but also with tears, compassion, and the heartbeat of empathy.

Example: A widow from the village said – “Shatakshi is like a family to me, giving me support during tough times.”

🎓 Revolution in Education – From Weapons to Pens

When children lose their homes in floods, their books are washed away, and their future seems engulfed in darkness, the “From Weapons to Pens” mission handed the pen back to their hands. Today, hundreds of children are not just learning to read—they are learning to hope.

Example: A child named Sonu said – “If Shatakshi didn’t exist, I would be doing labor work. Today, I dream of becoming a doctor.”

👧 Daughters’ Voices – Voice of Silence

Many daughters were trapped in the dark tunnels of child marriage, malnutrition, and exploitation. The “Voice of Silence” initiative broke their silence, giving them access to education, nutrition, and respect. Today, their smiles are the mission’s greatest achievement.

Example: Pinky said – “Now I will complete my studies, not get married.”

🚑 Race for Life – Shatakshi Free Ambulance

One flood night, a mother and her newborn lost their lives due to the lack of medical resources. This pain gave birth to our 24×7 free ambulance service. Today, the sound of the siren has become the music of life for many families.

Example: An elderly man said – “If the ambulance hadn’t arrived on time, I wouldn’t be alive today.”

🦠 During the COVID Era – When the World Stopped

During the COVID-19 pandemic, when everything was shut down, Shatakshi kept going. Ambulances transported patients to hospitals. The Annapurna Kitchen delivered meals to hungry families during lockdown. Migrant workers received rations, masks, and medicines. At that time, this organization became not just a service, but a pillar of hope.

Example: A migrant worker said – “When everyone shut their doors, Shatakshi embraced us.”

🍲 Annapurna Kitchen – Battle Against Hunger

Since August 14, 2024, not a single day has passed without this service. Every day, in 15 villages, hot meals reach 42 helpless and elderly people. This is not just food—it is a gesture of love and dignity.

Example: A grandmother smiled and said – “These meals are like offerings from God to me.”

🌸 Final Farewell – With Dignity

Where abandoned bodies go unnoticed, Shatakshi gives them support. Under the “Final Farewell” mission, over 900 people have received a dignified last journey. We believe that both life and death deserve respect.

Example: A local resident said – “My father received a dignified farewell. I am grateful to Shatakshi for that.”

✨ The Soul of Shatakshi

This organization was not created for fame or recognition. It exists to wipe tears from every eye, to ensure no one sleeps hungry, and to empower daughters to grow with dreams, not fear.
